# ETL-VIA-SERVERLESS-COMPUTING-USING-AWS
This project is aimed to perform an ETL process via serverless computing using AWS. Visualising of the data is done by creating a serverless framework on the AWS account. The raw data is stored on S3 where a trigger is sent from S3 to Lambda function. The Lambda functions perform ETL(Extraction, Transformation and Loading). First, the raw data is extracted from S3 then the Lambda is directly triggered by the services such as S3.  At the end the data is loaded to the stand form S3. Python programming is used for this project and is developed using Amazon Web Services.
